## Why the game is so cool

This game is the game played when everything is lost. No wifi, no nothing just a command prompt and a python interpreter. 
Reminiscent to the old text adventures of yesteryear. 
In fact, fjot adventures is so portable, it can be played on a piece of paper 
and calculator. Therefore, fjot adventures is a pretty cool game, and you should give it a try.

## Options
If you are on linux or MacOS, it can be played without any dependencies, as MacOS and linux have preinstalled them already.
If you are on Windows, you will have to install python but if you are lazy, install the C++ port.
