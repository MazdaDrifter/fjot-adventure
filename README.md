## Why the game is so cool

This game is the game played when everything is lost. No wifi, no nothing just a command prompt. 
Reminiscent to the old text adventures of yesteryear. 
In fact, the idea of fjot adventures is so portable, it can be played on a piece of paper 
and calculator. Therefore, fjot adventures is a pretty cool game, and you should give it a try.

## What does it offer?

It offers the player, a complex take on the world of text adventures, there are a lot of topics and strategies involved in gameplay, and I could go forever talking and diving deep into it, just look at the docs. 

## Platforms
### Linux/WSL & MacOS
If you are on linux or MacOS, it can be played without any dependencies, as MacOS and linux have preinstalled them already.

### Windows
If you are on Windows, you will have to install python but if you are lazy, install the C++ port.
