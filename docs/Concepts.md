# Crafting
Whenever a player interacts with the *Trader* from the *Village* a menu appears for crafting. It looks like so:

```
+===================================+
Crafting Menu
+===================================+
Inventory:
[1] 23 Bismuth
[2] 4 Iron Pieces
[3] 5 Twigs
[4] Empty
+===================================+

```

A player can combine two items together using the `+` operator.

# Thirst
To buy a jug, the trader usually sells it for 10 coins. Once a jug has been bought the player will need to find a lake or a river to supply for water. 

# Currency
Coins can be obtained by killing enemies or selling items. You can use these in the various shops.
