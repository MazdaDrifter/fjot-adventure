# Crafting
Whenever a player interacts with the *Trader* from the *Village* a menu appears for crafting. It looks like so:

```
+===================================+
Crafting Menu
+===================================+
Inventory:
[1] 23 Bismuth
[2] 4 Iron Pieces
[3] 5 Twigs
[4] Empty
+===================================+
>
```

A player can combine two items together using the `+` operator.
